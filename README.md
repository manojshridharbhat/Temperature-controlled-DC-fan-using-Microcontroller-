# Temperature-controlled-DC-fan-using-Microcontroller-
The main aim of this project  is to monitor the surrounding temperature and change the speed of the fan  according to the temperature changes i.e. the speed should increase with a  rise in temperature and should decrease with a drop in temperature. The  temperature would be displayed through the LCD which is interfaced with the  8051 microcontroller.
The FAN is controlled by a PWM wave given to it by 
the microcontroller, the power given to the fan is lesser in low temperature 
and greater in high temperature.By controlling the speed of the fan at 
different temperatureâ€™s we save a lot of energy throughout the day. Instead 
of a fan running at full speed all day which requires a lot of energy, if the 
speed is controlled and given as necessary so that a lot of energy can be saved.The 
main principle behind the working is PWM i.e. pulse width modulation.
